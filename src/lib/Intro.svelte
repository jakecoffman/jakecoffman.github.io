  <h2>Hello, world!</h2>

  <p>
    Hi, I'm Jake Coffman and I am a Software Developer in St. Louis Missouri.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and have worked professionally in C++, Python, JavaScript,
    Java, Groovy, Ruby, Go, and C#.
  </p>

  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <p>
    I started out working on low level security libraries and various security related GUIs at Cerner.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I moved on to doing low level network programming on a 3-D distributed simulation of fighter jets
    at Boeing. I started to pick up web development while I was there, too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next I worked at a startup called Appistry where I helped create an ETL system that took HL7 data and
    transformed it into SQL. I created a search interface for that data and various other "Big Data" web interfaces.
  </p>

  <p>
    After that, I worked at World Wide Technology for 7 years! I was the principal developer behind the ATC Lab Gateway,
    and built the backend of the custom CMS that powers wwt.com.
  </p>

  <p>Now I work for GitHub where I work on Dependabot. You can find me doing OSS on
    <a href="https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core">dependabot-core</a>!
  </p>

  <h3>Interests</h3>
  <p>
    I like game development and have been working on games in my free time. Game development is
    refreshing and completely unlike web development which I have been doing for my day job. Working in 2D and
    3D with physics engines is a fun challenge.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also like web development as a way to expose what I do to potentially billions of people.
